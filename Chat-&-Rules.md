3. Posting binaries is forbidden (who knows what might be in there).
4. Selling in our Discord server is not allowed.
5. Keep it mature, don't insult people and have fun.
6. Github link's to forks of FeroxRev's PokemonGo.RocketAPI belong in the #forks channels
 * Posting links to all other bots are not allowed. This includes web services, scripts, and forum posts.
 * Extended discussion of other bots can be reserved for the #off-topic or private messages

Keep in mind that new rules can be added at any time. Moderators, helpers and other ranks have the right to mute, ban and kick if needed.

### Some more info
Just to clarify few things... The discord server is for the Necronomicon main repo, support for other forks will be at the very least limited (if not totally unsupported) to the #forks channels.

This does not mean we forbid any forks, this is all open-source so by all means. We just wish you contribute to the community.
