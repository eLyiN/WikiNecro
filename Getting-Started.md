## GPX Pathing Setup
1. Go to [WTracks](https://wtracks.appspot.com/).
2. Create your path by right clicking on the map. Use as many points as you'd like! It is recommended to have the path end near the beginning of the path so it can loop.
3. Save without changing default settings.
4. Remove the [highlighted block of data](http://i.imgur.com/Px6Ba22.png) from the .gpx file using NotePad++ or NotePad.
5. Save the .gpx wherever your .exe is.
6. In the config set `UseGPXPathing` to `True` and `GPXFile` to `X.gpx` where `X` is your filename.
7. Set your default coordinates near the start of your path to begin pathing.
8. Launch the program!
