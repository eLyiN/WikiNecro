### Rules
1. Do not argue with ranks, this means anyone who has a rank higher than Donator.
2. Do not post pre-compiled programs/links.
3. Posting only binary is forbidden (who knows what might be in there).
4. Selling in the our Discord server is not allowed.
5. Keep it mature, don't insult people and have fun.

Keep in mind that new rules can be added at any time. Moderators, helpers and other ranks have the right to ban and kick if needed.

### Some more info
Just to clarify few things... The discord server is for the Necronomicon main repo, support for other forks/bots will be at the very least limited (if not totally unsupported).

This does not mean we forbid any forks, this is all open-source so by all means. We just wish you contribute to the community.
